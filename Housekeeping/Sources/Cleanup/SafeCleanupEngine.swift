        Housekeeping Quarantine
        ==================

        This folder is where Housekeeping puts things when you clean them.

        Nothing here has been deleted. Every item below is a full copy of what
        used to be on your Mac, sitting exactly as it was. If you change your
        mind, open Housekeeping, choose Manage Quarantine, and press Restore: the
        item goes back to the exact path it came from.

        You can also put things back by hand. Open one of the dated folders,
        then "Items", and drag what you want back to where it belongs. Housekeeping
        will not mind — it re-checks what is actually there every time it opens.

        Nothing in here is secret and nothing is hidden. Feel free to look.

        Deleting things from this folder by hand is permanent. Housekeeping cannot
        bring something back that it can no longer find. If you want the space
        back but you are not certain, leave it: this folder is the safety net,
        and it only costs the space the item already took.

        Each transaction keeps a manifest.json recording where every item came
        from. That file is how Restore knows the way home. Please leave it alone.
